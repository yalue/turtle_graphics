Simple Turtle Graphics Tester
=============================

This is a basic executable that generates two .png images using
`github.com/yalue/turtle_graphics`. To build it, navigate to this directory
and run `go build`. Next, run `simple_graphics` (or `simple_graphics.exe`).
Doing so should create two .png image files.
