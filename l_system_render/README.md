Turtle Graphics: Dragon Curve Example
=====================================

This is a basic executable that generates `dragon_curve.png`: The
[dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) drawn to 16
iterations. It uses the `turtle_graphics` package along with my extremely
basic [L-system package](https://github.com/yalue/l_system).

To build it, navigate to this directory and run `go build`. Next, run
`l_system_render` (or `l_System_render.exe`). This should create
`dragon_curve.png`.
